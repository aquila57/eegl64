Installing eegl:

Be sure you have installed the GNU Scientific Library for
validating chi square tests..

sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev

Some of the programs use X Windows and Curses.

Some of the test scripts use the dieharder package to run
standard random number tests.  One script uses the R
language to perform the Anderson-Darling test on normal
data.

Make shell scripts executable.

chmod 755 *.sh

Next compile the programs.

./inst.sh

To de-install eegl:

./deinst.sh

# Other platforms.

The eegl64 random number generator may be installed under
mingw on Microsoft Windows.  Use the eeglstrt.c subroutine
to initialize the generator.  The parameter for eeglstrt.c
is a 32 bit unsigned integer, like date and time.

Microsoft Windows mingw does not include the GNU Scientific
Library or X Windows.  It does include curses.

To see how to test eegl, read TESTING.
Some of these test programs use new curses, X Windows,
and dieharder.

To read about the eegl generator, read README.eegl.
